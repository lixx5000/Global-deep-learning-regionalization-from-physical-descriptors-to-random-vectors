This folder documents the number of year experiments to explore reandom vectors' efficacy on the data inadequacy scenario limited by training data length. We alter the weather data from 10 years to 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year. 

1 year of data: October 1st, 2007 to September 30th, 2008
2 years of data: October 1st, 2006 to September 30th, 2008
