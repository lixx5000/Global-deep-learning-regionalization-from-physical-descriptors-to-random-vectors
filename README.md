# Global-deep-learning-regionalization-from-physical-descriptors-to-random-vectors
The code for performing global deep learning regionalization from physical descriptors to random vectors. The paper is in reviewing processes. 

The code for reproducing the workflow is being organized and will be published soon. The scripts are largely based on Kratzert's work on Catchment-Aware LSTMs for Regional Rainfall-Runoff Modeling (https://github.com/kratzert/ealstm_regional_modeling).
